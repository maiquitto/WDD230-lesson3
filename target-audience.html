            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>The goal is to support all businesses in the community. A chamber of commerce typically lets any business join, including competitors. That means every bakery in town can join the same chamber of commerce, even though they have similar target audiences.
            <br>You should join a chamber of commerce that you plan on being actively involved with. Joining a local chamber of commerce is usually best, considering the familiarity with the area you work in, but you can also join national and international chambers.
